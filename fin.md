# 50-50 PROFIT SHARING INVESTMENT MODEL: A Case Study

50-50 Profit Sharing as an academic research project of financial modelling illustrates that "Value motivates automatically". It eliminates investing in uncertainty between risk balanced equal partners. 

_Financial Modelling and Product Development  research project is an example of successful use of innovative Mind Mapping._

## == OUR ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING AND INSIGHTS ==

1. Mind Mapping over the web in various books and journals has been only highlighted as a tool for representation with fancy diagrams and colors, whereas our originality in _understanding_ them and letting our work/knowledge _evolve_ has been due to our using it as an analysis tool for aiding evolution of our own understanding, both of Mind Mapping as an indispensable tool and the specific project domain.
 2. In our Financial Modelling and Product Development research project, we used Mind Mapping as knowledge development tool to collect, harness, filter ideas, then letting ideas fill several sheets.
 3. Later, once we reached conclusion in thinking about modelling and product development we let all charts ideation **combine** into a big chart. 
 4. Ofcourse all of other Mind Maps and this big one chart looked messy. This depicted **complexity** reflecting the need for clear understanding. 
 5. One important point that emerges is that, filtering mechanism is an internal process, here the Central Processing Unit (CPU) is **human brain**. 
 - Humans haven't been able to develop a machine that can think and understand. 
 - Devices only compute.
 -  Mind Maps are essentially "Programs and Data" operating in resonance with human brain. 
 6. However this process of Mind Map Development is all about emerging _beauty as understanding_ using basic shapes, arrows, pens, highlighters.
 - There's not much on the hardware side if one sees it closely! 
 - It's all about internal **thinking** process and it's evolution that needs understanding, and the understanding that gets _developed_ as a result. 
 7. In our Financial Modelling and Product Development research project, Mind Mapping was an _analytical tool_ from beginning till end. 
 8. Sixty A4 sized sheets were converted into one big chart. This chart was then factored into categories like - 
 - Types of Markets,
 - Trading System, 
 - Taxation, 
 - Market Competition, 
 - Brokers, 
 - Brokerage, 
 - Settlement Mechanism etc.
 - Each subdomain is in itself an ocean. 
 - Similarly in field of Finance, **choice of numbers** is always crucial. 
 9. From this big chart made using a pencil, another chart with just four categories was prepared. 
 - This was sudden emergence of clear understanding as it highlighted clarity in presentation. 
 - We can thus infer that **Presentation** _outside_ is reflection of **Understanding** _inside_. (in the spirit of Bhagavat Gita 5.11) 
 10. Thereafter, product marketing **flyer** was presented in only two A4 sheets and each word of it was very carefully crafted. As an example, taking cue from marketing campaigns also, such as Jio advertises their offers being 20% above competition. 
 - No extra word was used. 
 - No verbosity. 
 - Just short and lucid invitation in form of two pages. 
 - Even the tag names evolved as we finalized product over the days. 
11. This financial project matched the _public ledger verification design_ postulates of **BLOCKCHAIN** in concept, its four pillars being - Distributed, Immutable, Encrypted, Transparent/Trusted (**DIET**). 
- The website showed trades under these fundamentals. 
12. Lot of viewers, investors, traders joined whatsapp groups, telegram channel (even saw trades on instagram stories!) and stayed, due to **profitable** trades on Nifty Options and USDINR Forex Options on NSE using our self developed trading system. 
13. Trades appeared in real time but they could only be opened using the daily password once the trading strategy was implemented by eligible partners. 
- Publishing in realtime showcased that trades were genuine. 
- Files could instantly be downloaded. 
- However they could not be opened. 
- Passwords were only published after execution of trading strategy for the general public members of WhatsApp group and Telegram channel.
14. Once trade files were downloaded they couldn't be changed by us. 
- Obviously, we couldn't go on some other system to alter files later to match the market.
- We didn't even know who all were seeing! 
- This was indeed magical as participants participated fully as they didn't have to indulge in revealing identity or fill any web forms to even view trades. 
- So a fairly **transparent** system! Thus, **trusted**. 
- Thus, files and trades were **immutable**! Since we couldn't change files we also couldn't change trades once placed. 
-  Immutability ensured genuineness of trades published in realtime.
15. While, academically this project received far and wide appreciation, it also brought in focus the other side of  **human psychology** that looks for _exploiting_ others, either as service provider or client. 
16. Investor clients **primarily** didn't follow the plan. Reason, ofcourse **lack of TRUST** despite great verified profitable performance.
- They always attempted to transfer complete risk on one party who trade financial markets, manage negative moods of clients, who call at straight 9 AM just at start of market without making due and complete settlement payments. 
- This led to our strict policy of **NO SETTLEMENTS, NO TRADING.**
17. In **50-50 Profit Sharing (the present name)**, we as traders are at initial risk of our time, skill and settlement money of 2% as 50% of every 4% profit. If partner client doesn't pay us we lose 2% but there's greater loss at end of partner client who **loses partnership**. 
18. They say, all is well that ends well! 
- 50-50 Profit Sharing hits bull's eye, eliminating risk at both ends as both partners get instant reward of 2% (first settlement and thereafter at every 4% Profit, no yearly waiting, or promise or binding).
- Straight cash in account! Proof of the pudding lies in eating. 
19. Even after taxation being covered by client partner of the total profits gained, client partner stands at chance of earning more than 50% yearly interest! Sometimes even more depending ofcourse on various factors. 
20. Money is a serious matter. 
- Markets are not for everyone. 
- Investment needs right psychological parameters. 
21. Over and above, all this wasn't possible if every step wasn't clearly always jotted and written down in form of Mind Map.
- **Analysis** was only possible all throughout - 
    - Ideation, 
    - Product Development, 
    - Partnership Management, 
    - Social Media Campaign, 
    - Product Improvement, 
    - Name Conventions' Development via Mind Mapping technique as tool for **UNDERSTANDING AND CAPACITY BUILDING**.
22. Last but not the least, biggest success of Financial Modelling and Product Development research project was gaining **insights** (internal) -
    
         i. Finance with investors involves seemingly impossible work of managing the investment and the impossible work of managing the investors.
     
        ii. If you see money, you lose. If you see knowledge, you gain. (Bhagavat Gita 5.11 reiterated, it's all about internal growth, सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा आत्म शुद्धये)
